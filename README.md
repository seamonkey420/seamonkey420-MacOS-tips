Welcome to the seamonkey420 MacOS tips wiki!
This is a dumping ground of my own personal tips, tweaks, hacks/work arounds for things related to MacOS. 

Started Feb 2025 after getting a used 2021 Macbook Pro 14" M1 Max.

Update as of April 12, 2025; EA App in Whiskey/Heroic no longer works after an update to EA App/Client/Launcher. :( Crossover may be only way now.


Previously I was a daily Windows 10/11 user and work in IT for last 20+ years. 
These tips are from my experience of moving from Windows to MacOS and replicating my previous 
Windows based workflow.
